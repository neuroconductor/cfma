Description: Performs causal functional mediation analysis (CFMA) for
        functional treatment, functional mediator, and functional
        outcome. This package includes two functional mediation model
        types: (1) a concurrent mediation model and (2) a historical
        influence mediation model. See Zhao et al. (2018), Functional
        Mediation Analysis with an Application to Functional Magnetic
        Resonance Imaging Data, <arXiv:1805.06923> for details.
